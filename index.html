    <!--Pseudo code of GifTastic
        *An array of "strings" is to be created that contains topics of interest - the array should be assigned to a variable called "topics."
        *Buttons should appear in the HTML that link to the items in the array.
        *When a button is "clicked," 10 STATIC images (related to the button), from the GIPHY API, should appear on the page.  
        *The rating (from the GIPHY API site) for every gif image should appear under the image.
        *A user input box should accept new topics of interest that will be pushed to the topics array.
        *Any new topics of interest added through the user input box will be displayed as a button.
        *When any buttons created from new topics of interest are clicked on, 10 STATIC images and their ratings (related to that button)
         will display on the page.
        *If any static image on the page is clicked it should toggle into ANIMATE mode, and when it is clicked again it should toggle back
         to STATIC mode.
         *When a topic button is clicked, any current images on the page should be replaced by images related to the new button clicked.-->
